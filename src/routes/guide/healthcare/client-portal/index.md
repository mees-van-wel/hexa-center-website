# Client portal

The client portal functionality is part of the Medical module. The Medical module is a paid feature, ask your Hexa Center representative for more information about paid features. The client portal functionality allows (external) clients to fill out questionnaires made by users. Questionnaires are made via the programs page and are part of a client's dossier.

## 1. Sending programs to clients

To be able to send a program to a client first navigate to the correct dossier, containing the program that needs to be send out. Make sure you have selected the correct program from the `timeline overview`. The name of the selected dossier is shown at the top of the screen, next to the `Clients overview`. The name of the selected dossier is also highlighted in the `timeline overview`, the highlight color depends on your color preferences. For more information about color preferences please refer to the [Preferences](/system/preferences "Preferences") page.
Once you have made sure the correct dossier has been selected, click on the `Mail to clients` button to send an email containing a link to the questionnaire to your clients. You can make sure your email was send to the client by checking the `Mailed on` text, which will appear under the button used to send an email. The last date an email was send to the client will also be printed next to this bit of text. The button's text will also change from `Mail to clients` to: `Send another email`.
These UI changes will happen regardless of the actual status of the email that was sent out, even if the email did not officially arrive in the client's emailbox. Our system has no way of tracking an email once it has been sent out. Please refer to the overview below for reasons as to why a client might not recieve an email.
The client's email box spam filters are blocking the email, either placing it in a spam folder, or blocking it outright.
The client's email field is not up to date.
The client's email box is full.
The client has blocked the Hexa-center email address.

### 1.1 Guidelines for sending programs to clients

To send a program for it be filled in by a client is made as easy and straightforward to grasp as possible. But it is important to first have an understanding of the guidelines and prerequisites that come with sending programs to clients.

1. Only external steps are viewable by a client when sending programs. Non-external steps cannot be viewed by clients.
2. Completed steps can still be viewed by clients, however their given answers are greyed out and cannot be edited.
3. Answers provided by clients can be reviewed through the dossier page, but reloading the page is required for the answers to be loaded in.
4. Marking a step as complete is not permanent. After marking a dossier as complete the button text will change accordingly to: `Mark as incomplete`. Clicking this button will mark the step as incomplete, allowing the client to once again edit their answers.
5. Make sure the client's email address is up-to-date.
   Please make sure to first understand these guidelines before sending out programs to clients.

## 2. Client knowhow

This paragraph was written to help answer any questions clients might have about the client portal, emails originating from Hexa Center, or general questions clients might have about answering program questionnaires.
Clients might call to ask about the legitimacy of an email they have recieved. Clients might recieve an email from Hexa Center without having been informed about the fact they were going to recieve an email in the first place.
If you yourself get contacted by a client asking about the legitimacy of an email and you're not entirely sure yourself about the legitimacy of an email, feel free to contact your Hexa-Center representative. Its always better to be safe than sorry, especially in the IT world, where scams and phising attempts are common.

## 3. Client portal

Clients can fill out questionnaires via the client portal. Clients are invited to fill out questionnaires via email. The email containing the link to the questionnaire looks this:
![Client Portal Email](/images/guide/client-portal-email.jpg "Client Portal Email")
A client can approach the client portal by clicking on the text `"Click here to submit your questionnaires."` This link will open using the client's default browser. The client portal is supported on desktop, as well as mobile devices.

### 3.1 Testing your own questionnaires

To test your questionnaire before sending it out to your client(s) you can add yourself as a client via the dossiers functionality. To read more about the dossier functionality, please refer to the following [Dossiers](/medical/dossiers "Dossiers") page.
After adding yourself to a (test) dossier, as well ass making sure the right program(s) are selected, send out the invitation email via the `Mail to Clients` button. This email will be sent to your work email address, which is set using the `email` field on your user page. Please refer to the [Users](/system/users "Users") page for more information on how to edit user profiles. Below are 3 methods for testing your own questionnaires.

**Method 1:**

Navigate to your work email address' inbox and copy the link by, on Windows 10 or later, right clicking on the text `"Click here to submit your questionnaires"` and selecting the `copy link address` option. Open an incognito window in your browser. The steps required to open an incognito window differ per browser but on most modern browsers the key combination `CTRL SHIFT N` opens a new incognito window. Paste the link from your clipboard into the address field in your browser and press ENTER.

**Method 2:**

Just like method #1, navigate to your work email address' inbox and copy the link by, on Windows 10 or later, right clicking on the text `"Click here to submit your questionnaires"` and selecting the `copy link address` option. Open this link in a different browser where you're not logged in to Hexa Center. For example, if you normally use Google Chrome, paste the link into Microsoft Edge.

**Method 3:**

Go to the email-link via a different device, like your mobile phone. If you approach the email-link from a browser where you aren't already logged in to Hexa Center, you will be able to fill out the questionnaire from there.
