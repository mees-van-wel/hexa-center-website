# Dossiers

The Dossier functionality is used to create a medical dossier for clients.

## 1. Dossier definition

A dossier in Hexa Center is a fully customizable report linked to an individual client or multiple clients. Dossiers can be customized according to your organisational needs, by adding sections, notes and even files like pictures and videos. More information about programs can be found on the [Programs](../programs/index.md "Programs") page.

## 2. Dossier overview

To access the dossier overview simply click on the `Dossiers` button under the `Healthcare` section. Navigating to the dossier overview page shows you a list of all available dossiers. To view a users' dossier you can also navigate to the user overview, there that users' dossiers are listed by **date** and **number**. Each dossier, and other items, have a **unique** number assigned to them. If no dossiers exist for that user, the dossier section will not be visible.

You can only access the dossier overview if you have sufficient permissions to do so. More information about roles and permissions can be found on the [Roles and Permissions](../../essentials/roles/index.md "Roles and permissions") page. We are still working on creating a per-page based overview of all relevant roles & permissions.

## 2.1 Items overview

Via the `Items` section, found on the right side of your screen, you can filter between showing only programs, notes, or files added to this dossier. By **default** this filter is set to the **programs** view. The `Timeline` shows all items added to this dossier.

## 3. Creating dossiers

Click on the `+ New` button to start the dossier creation process. Unlike other elements, a dossier does not have a name. A dossier's name is automatically generated using the dossiers **creation date** and its **number**.

## 3.1 Adding clients to a dossier

Click on the empty `Clients field` to to add clients to the dossier. Added clients are added to the `Clients field` and can be easily removed by clicking on the small `X` icon next to that client's name. Once all clients are added, click on the `+ Create` button to finalize the creation process. Don't worry, you can always add and remove clients later, as explained in **section 4.1 "Adding and removing clients"**.

Just like when adding users in other parts of Hexa Center, you can easily filter for part of a users' name to speed up the adding process. For example, the name **John Doe** can be easily found by filtering for **any part** of John's name, like **jo**, **john**, **Doe** or **hn Do**.

## 4. Editing dossiers

To edit a dossier, first select the dossier you would like to edit from the list of available dossiers. Please refer to the screenshot below to see what the editing dossier screen looks like.

![Dossier editing](/images/guide/dossiers-update.jpg "Dossier editing")

After navigating to the dossier you want to edit you will be able to add dossier items via the timeline system. A detailed explanation on how to add dossier items can be found by reading section 5: **Adding dossier items**.

### 4.1 Adding and removing clients

Clients can easily be added later on in the dossier creation proces by selecting the client in the `Add client` field and clicking on the `Add` button. To remove a client click on the trashcan icon next to that clients name. A dossier needs to have one client added to it at all times.

## 5. Adding dossier items

Editing dossiers is different from editing other data within Hexa Center. Unlike, for example, a property, a dossier consists of a 3 different items; **Programs**, **Notes** and **Files**.

Items can be added by clicking on the `+ Add` button found under the `Timeline section`. Once an item is added the current date will immediatally be displayed next to it. This proces creates a sequential timeline of events, which makes it easy to keep track of when and what changes were made in a dossier.

### 5.1 Adding programs

Information about how to create, view, edit and delete programs can be found on the: [Programs](../programs/index.md "Programs") page.

Add a program to a dossier by first clicking on the `+ Add` button in the timeline section, then proceed by selecting the `Program` option from the list of available items. A dialog box will now appear, allowing you to choose a program from the dropdown menu. Search for a specific program by clicking on the empty field and typing in the program's name, or by simply clicking on the field to manually search for the program using the dropdown list. Click on the program's name from the dropdown menu to select it. The previously empty field will now contain the program's name.

Click on the `+ Add` button to add the program to the dossier. Changes made to a program will not be synced to dossiers where that program has already been added. Think of adding a program to a dossier like copying over the contents of that program to the dossier.

![Dossier adding program](/images/guide/dossiers-add-program.jpg "Dossier adding programs")

#### 5.1.1 Adding steps to the program

Steps in which the `Addition mode` is set to `Manually` are not automatically added to any program you add to a dossier. Manually add a step to the program by first navigating to the correct program via the `Dossier timeline` section.

Then proceed by clicking on the `+ Add` button, continue by clicking on the empty field to select a step from the dropdown.

The same step can be added to a dossier multiple times. Read more about steps and programs on the [Programs](../programs/index.md "Programs") page.

### 5.2 Adding notes

Open the timeline section and create a Note using the `Note` menu option in the dropdown. This action opens a dialog box, allowing you to specify a name for your note. Currently there are no restrictions relating to the length of a note's title, you can use special characters, cyrillic or other writing methods, and even emojis!

After entering a name for your note note and clicking on the `+ Add` button, the note will be added and it will subsequently appear in the timeline.

The `Note` item allows you to input text via the **Rich text editor**. Editing text using a Rich Text Editor can be compared to editing text via applications like Microsoft Word or Wordpad. It works with the same ribbon system as those aforementioned applications, but simplified to purely focus on text editing.

### 5.3 Uploading files

By clicking on the `+ Add` button under the timeline section and clicking on `File` option, you are presented with your operating system's file explorer. From there you will able to select a file.

Hexa Center allows users to upload a multitude of different file types, like **image files**, **audio files**, **video files**, **PDFs**, **Excel and other Office files like Word**

Select a file using your system's file explorer, this process will vary depending on the operating system used, if you are unable to select a file please contact your Hexa Center representative. Hexa Center will now process your file, uploading it to our servers. Just like when adding notes or dossiers, the file is registered in the `timeline overview`.

## 5.3.1 Viewing, downloading and deleting files

To view, download or delete a file, select it from the `timeline overview` by clicking on the button containing the file's name.

![Dossier select file from timeline](/images/guide/dossier-select-file-from-timeline.jpg "Dossier select file from timeline")

Clicking on `View` opens the file in a new tab. Depending on your browser's capabilities and the type of uploaded file, your browser should allow you to listen to audio files, play video files and view image files.

Clicking on `Download` saves the selected file using your browsers built-in download function to your computer. Select the file from either the top right or bottom left to open it, again depending on the browser used.

Clicking on `Delete` **permanently** deletes the selected file from the dossier and timeline overview.

## 6. Deleting dossiers

To delete a dossier first navigate to the dossier you would like to delete. On the dossier editing page you can delete a dossier via the `Delete` button. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion. Click on `Yes` to delete the dossier. Clicking on `No`, or anywhere outside of the pop-up will cancel the deletion process. Deleting a dossier is permanent and **cannot** be undone.

![Dossier deleting](/images/guide/dossiers-delete.jpg "Dossier deleting")

## 7. Editing programs which have already been added to dossiers

Changes made to programs are not carried over to programs already added to the dossier timeline. For example, changes made to the title of a program will not carry over to the version of the program already added to the dossier.

Adding a program to a dossier is more akin to **copying** over that program, rather than linking it to the already existing dossier. Keep this in mind when adding a program to a dossier, its best to **finish editing a program before adding it to dossiers**.

## 8. Filling out questionnaires

There are two ways a questionnaire can be filled in. By sending it out to clients via email, to have clients fill out the questionnaire via the client portal page, or by a user manually inputting the answers of the clients via the Dossier page.

More information about the client portal page can be found on the [Client portal](../client-portal/index.md "Client portal") page.

### 8.1. Via the Dossier page

Questionnaires can also be filled in by (internal) users working in Hexa Center. This is especially useful for in-person interviews, a client can answers questions given by the user while those answers are written down by the user during the interview.

Simply select the right program, step and client and start filling in the answers. Mark the step as completed via the `Mark as complete` button.

![Dossier program manual completion](/images/guide/dossiers-program-manual-completion.JPG "Dossier program manual completion")

## 9. Viewing given answers & completion status

Answers given by clients are automatically send to the dossier's step page and can be viewed on a per-client basis. The same goes for answers entered manually by users.

The completion status of a program can be viewed via the dossiers' page. The completion status of an individual step can be found via the dossier's program page. A checkmark next to the step's name indicates the step is marked as completed.

An example of a completed step with che checkmark icon:

An example of a completed program with the checkmark icon:

### 9.1 Editing given answers

A user can edit the answers given by clients via the client portal by clicking on the `Edit` button. This allows for the client to fill out answers like they would when the responder mode is set to `Internal`. Read more about filling in answers via the dossier page in **section 8.1. Via the Dossier page**. Read more about different responder modes on the [Programs](../programs/index.md "Programs") page.
