# Dossiers

The dossier functionality is part of the Healthcare module. The Healthcare module is a paid feature, ask your Hexa Center representative for more information about paid features. The Dossier functionality is used to create a medical dossier for clients.

## 1. Dossier definition

A dossier in Hexa Center is a fully customizable report linked to an individual client or multiple clients. Dossiers can be customized according to your organisational needs, by adding sections, notes and even files like pictures and videos. More information about programs can be found on the [Programs](../programs/index.md "Programs") page.

## 2. Dossier overview

To access the dossier overview simply click on the `Dossiers` button under the `Healthcare` section. Navigating to the dossier overview page will generate a list of all available dossiers. To view a users' dossier you can also navigate to the user overview, there that users' dossiers are listed by **date** and **number**. If no dossiers exist for that user, the dossier section will not be visible.

You can only access the dossier overview if you have sufficient permissions to do so. The required permissions to view, edit or create dossiers are listed in the overview section on the right side of your screen. More information about roles and permissions can be found on the [Roles and Permissions](../../essentials/roles/index.md "Roles and permissions") page.

## 2.1 Items overview

Via the `Items` section, found on the right side of your screen, you can filter between showing only programs, notes, or files added to this dossier. By **default** this filter is set to the **programs** view. The `Timeline` shows all items added to this dossier.

## 3. Creating dossiers

Click on the `+ New` button to start the dossier creation process. Unlike other elements, a dossier does not have a name. A dossier's name is automatically generated using the dossiers **creation date** and its **number**. Click on the empty `Clients field` to start selecting clients. Added clients are added to the `Clients field` and can be easily removed by clicking on the small `X` icon next to that client's name. Once all clients are added, click on the `+ Create` button to finalize the creation process.

Just like when adding users in other parts of Hexa Center, you can easily filter for part of a users' name to speed up the adding process. For example, the name **Jerome Powell** can be easily found by filtering for **any part** of Jerome's name, like **jer**, **ome**, **po** or **well**.

## 4. Editing dossiers

To edit a dossier, first select the dossier you would like to edit from the list of available dossiers. Please refer to the screenshot below to see what the editing dossier screen looks like.

![Dossier editing](/images/guide/dossiers-update.jpg "Dossier editing")

After navigating to the dossier you want to edit you will be able to add dossier items via the timeline system. A detailed explanation on how to add dossier items can be found by reading section 6: **Adding dossier items**.

### 4.1 Adding and removing clients

Clients can easily be added later on in the dossier creation proces by selecting the client in the `Add client` field and clicking on the `Add` button. To remove a client click on the trashcan icon next to that clients name. A dossier always needs to have one client added to it at all times.

## 5. Deleting dossiers

To delete a dossier first navigate to the dossier you would like to delete. On the dossier editing page you can delete a dossier via the `Delete` button. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion. Click on `Yes` to delete the dossier. Clicking on `No`, or anywhere outside of the pop-up will cancel the deletion process. Deleting a dossier is permanent and **cannot** be undone.

## 6. Adding dossier items

Editing dossiers is different from editing other data within Hexa Center. Unlike, for example, a property, a dossier consists of a 3 different items; **Programs**, **Notes** and **Files**.

Items can be added by clicking on the `+ Add` button found under the `Timeline section`. Once an item is added the current date will immediatally be displayed next to it. This proces creates a sequential timeline of events, which makes it easy to keep track of when and what changes were made in a dossier.

### 6.1 Adding programs

Information about how to create, view, edit and delete programs can be found on the: [Programs](../programs/index.md "Programs") page.

Add a program to a dossier by first clicking on the `+ Add` button in the timeline section, then proceed by selecting the `Program` option from the list of available items. A dialog box will now appear, allowing you to choose a program from the dropdown menu. Search for a specific program by clicking on the empty field and typing in the program's name, or by simply clicking on the field to manually search for the program using the dropdown list. Click on the program's name from the dropdown menu to select it. The previously empty field will now contain the program's name.

Click on the `+ Add` button to add the program to the dossier. Changes made to a program will not be synced to dossiers where that program has already been added. Think of adding a program to a dossier like copying over the contents of that program to the dossier.

### 6.2 Adding notes

Add a note by selecting the `Note` menu option from dropdown menu in the timeline section. A dialog box containing an empty field will now appear, allowing you to type out a name for your note. Currently there are no restrictions relating to the length of a note's title, you can use special characters, cyrillic or other writing methods, and even emojis!

After entering a name for your note note and clicking on the `+ Add` button, the note will be added and it will subsequently appear in the timeline.
Upon adding a note you will gain access to a Rich Text Editor. Editing text using a Rich Text Editor can be compared to editing text via applications like Microsoft Word or Wordpad. It works with the same ribbon system as those applications, but simplified to purely focus on text editing.

### 6.3 Uploading files

By clicking on the `+ Add` button under the timeline section and clicking on `File` option, you are presented with your operating system's file explorer. From there you will able to select a file.

Hexa Center allows users to upload **image files**, **audio files** and even **video files**.

Select a file using your system's file explorer, this process will vary depending on the operating system used, if you are unable to select a file please contact your Hexa Center representative. Hexa Center will now process your file, uploading it to our servers. Just like when adding notes or dossiers, the file is registered in the `timeline overview`.

Reference the list below for an overview of allowed filetypes:

- .PNG
- .JFIF
- .PJPEG
- .JPEG
- .PJPEG
- .JPG

## 6.3.1 Viewing, downloading and deleting files

To view, download or delete a file, select it from the `timeline overview` by clicking on the button containing the file's name.

![Dossier select file from timeline](/images/guide/dossier-select-file-from-timeline.jpg "Dossier select file from timeline")

Clicking on `View` opens the file in a new tab. Depending on your browser's capabilities and the type of uploaded file, your browser should allow you to listen to audio files, play video files and view image files.

Clicking on `Download` saves the selected file using your browsers built-in download function to your computer. Select the file from either the top right or bottom left to open it, again depending on the browser used.

Clicking on `Delete` **permanently** deletes the selected file from the dossier.

## 7. Editing programs which have already been added to dossiers

Changes made to programs are not carried over to the programs in the dossier timeline, for example, changing the title of a program will not also change the title of a program which has already been added to a client's dossier. Adding a program to a dossier is more akin to **copying** over that program,rather than linking it to the already existing dossier. Keep this in mind when adding a program to a dossier, its best to **finish editing a program before adding it to dossiers**.

## 8. Sending questionnaires to clients

Sending out questionnaires to clients was designed to be as simple and easy to understand as possible, however there are some guidelines worth studying before sending out questionnaires. Read more about sending out questionnaires on the client portal page. [In the works]
