# Dossiers

The dossiers functionality is part of the Medical module. The Medical module is a paid feature, ask your Hexa Center representative for more information about paid features. The Dossier functionality is used to create a medical dossier for clients.

## 1. Dossier definition

A dossier in Hexa Center is a fully customizable report linked to an individual client or multiple clients. Dossiers can be customized according to your organisational needs, by adding sections, notes and even files like pictures and videos. More information about programs can be found on the [Programs](/medical/programs "Programs") page.

## 2. Dossier overview

The dossier overview can be found by clicking on dossiers, found under the medical header section. By navigating to the dossier overview page an overview of all dossiers will be generated. To view a users' dossier you can also navigate to the user overview. Click on the user you want to view the dossiers of and click on the dossier under the dossier section. If no dossiers exist for that user, the dossier section will not be visible.
You can only access the dossier overview if you have sufficient permissions to do so. The required permissions to view, edit or create dossiers are listed in the overview section on the right side of your screen. More information about roles and permissions can be found on the [Roles](../system/roles "Roles") page.

## 3. Creating dossiers

A dossier can be created via the dossier overview page. Click on the `+ New` button to start the dossier creation process. Unlike other elements, a dossier does not have a name. A dossier's name is automatically generated using the dossiers creation date and its number. Click on the empty `Clients field` to start selecting clients. Added clients are added to the `Clients field` and can be easily removed by clicking on the small `X` icon next to that client's name. Once all clients are added, click on the `+ Create` button to finalize the creation process.

## 4. Editing dossiers

To edit a dossier, first select the dossier you would like to edit from the list of available dossiers. Please refer to the screenshot below to see what the editing dossier screen looks like.

After navigating to the dossier you want to edit you will be able to add dossier items via the timeline system. A detailed explanation on how to add dossier items can be found by reading section 6: **Adding dossier items**.

### 4.1 Adding and removing clients

Clients can easily be added later on in the dossier creation proces by selecting the client in the `Add client` field and clicking on the `Add` button. To remove a client click on the trashcan icon next to that clients name. A dossier always needs to have one client added to it at all times.

## 5. Deleting dossiers

To delete a dossier first navigate to the dossier you would like to delete. On the dossier editing page you can delete a dossier via the `Delete` button. You will see a confirmation message at the top of your screen prompting you to confirm the deletion. Clicking on `No`, or anywhere outside of the pop-up will cancel the deletion process. Deleting a dossier is permanent and **cannot** be undone.

## 6. Adding dossier items

Editing dossiers is different from editing other data within Hexa Center, unlike for example a property, a dossier consists of a 3 different items; Programs, Notes and Files.
These items can be added by clicking on the `+ Add` button found under the `Timeline section`. Once an item is added the current date will immediatally be displayed next to it. This proces creates a sequential timeline of events, which makes it easy to keep track of when and what changes were made in a dossier.

### 6.1 Adding programs

In order to add programs to a dossier, a program must first be created. Information about how to create, view, edit and delete programs can be found on the: [Programs](/medical/programs "Programs") page.
By clicking on the `+ Add` button under the timeline section and selecting the `Program` option from the list of available dossier items, you will be greeted by a dialog box where you can select a program to add to this dossier. Select a program by first clicking on the empty program selection field, then choose a program from the list of available programs. Upon selecting a program it will fill the previously empty program selection field with the name of the program you have chosen. Click on the `+ Add` button to add the program to the dossier.
The selected program will now be loaded in. It is currently not possible to only add specific sections of a program to a dossier. For more information about program sections, please refer to the [Programs](/medical/programs "Programs") page. Changes made to a program will not be synced to dossiers where that program has already been added. Think of adding a program to a dossier like copying over the contents of that program to the dossier.

### 6.2 Adding notes

A note can be added by selecing the `Note` menu option. First, click on the `+ Add` button under the timeline section, then proceed to type in a name for your note and click on the `+ Add` button. Currently there are no restrictions relating to the length of a note's title, you can use special characters, cyrillic or other writing methods, and even emojis! After giving your note a name and clicking on the `+ Add` button, the note will be added and it will subsequently appear in the timeline.
Upon adding a note you will gain access to a Rich Text Editor. Editing text using a Rich Text Editor can be compared to editing text via applications like Microsoft Word or Wordpad. It works with the same ribbon system as those applications, but simplified to purely focus on editing text.

### 6.3 Uploading files

By clicking on the `+ Add` button under the timeline section and clicking on `File` option, you are presented with your operating system's file explorer. From there you will able to select a file.
Hexa Center allows users to upload **image files**, **audio files** and even **video files**.

Please reference the list below for an overview of allowed filetypes:

- .PNG
- .JFIF
- .PJPEG
- .JPEG
- .PJPEG
- .JPG
- .MP3
- .WAV
- .PDF
- .M4V

## 7. Editing programs which have already been added to dossiers

Changes made to programs are not carried over to the programs in the dossier timeline, for example, changing the title of a program will not also change the title of a program which has already been added to a client's dossier. Adding a program to a dossier is more akin to copying over that program,rather than linking it to the already existing dossier. Keep this in mind when adding a program to a dossier, its best to finish editing a program before adding it to dossiers.

## 8. Sending questionnaires to clients

The ability to send out questionnaires to clients was made as simple and easy to understand as possible, however there are some guidelines and general good to know facts worth studying before sending out questionnaires. Read more about sending out questionnaires on the [Client portal](/medical/client_portal "Client portal") page.
