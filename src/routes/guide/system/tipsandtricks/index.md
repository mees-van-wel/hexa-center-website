## 3. Text filtering

--todo: Ask if differentiate is allowed

Text filtering is a feature used for finding specific items from a (long) list. This makes it extremely easy to find items based on even a small part of that items name.

Every dropdown field in Hexa Center supports text filtering. Dropdown fields have a small `up and down` arrow icon next to them, to differentiate them from regular text fields. Clicking on the field shows all relevant selectable items. When entering text only items containing that text in their name are shown.

Examples dropdown fieldw. The dropdown fields are highlighted in red.

This example is taken from the `appointment creation` screen in the `calendar addon`

## 4. Date selector

The date selector is a feature used to easily select a specific date using intuitive button layouts. Its opened by clicking on a date field. The date selector consists of 3 different screens, the:

- Day selector
- Month selector
- Year selector

**The day selector:** The initial screen when clicking on a date field. Enables you to click through individual months, allowing you to choose a specific date within the selected month.

**The Month selector** In the day selector, click on the year and month to open the Month selector. This screen allows you to select a year via the `left and right arrow buttons`, and a specific month from that year via the abbreviated month names.

**Year selector:** Clicking on the year from the **Month selector** opens the Year Selector. Navigate through years by using the `left and right arrow buttons`, just like you would when selecting a day in the **Day selector**. Selecting a year brings you to the **month selector**, followed by the **Day selector**, basically allowing you to work back from years, to months, to individual days again.

## 5. Time selector

The time selector feature allows you to effortlessly select a specific time of day through modern UI design. The time field allows you to type in a specific time, as well as select a specific time via the time selector.

Start by clicking on the small clock icon next to the time field, this opens a dropdown-like menu in which you can scroll through specific times. Both the hour and minutes sections are individually scrollable. Chosen hours and minutes are automatically inserted into the time field.

Close the time selector by clicking anywhere on the pop-up/screen you're currently editing on.

## 6. Rich text editor

The rich text editor is a feature we are especially proud of. Using the rich text editor you can use markup to customize and style text according to their preferences. This capability empowers users to apply a wide range of formatting options to achieve the desired look and feel for their text content.

A list of supported markup elements can be found below:

TODO: add underlined, strikethrough, code, text, text sizes to markdown

- **Bold text**
- _Italic text_
- Underlined text
- Strikethrough text
- Code

- H1, H2, H3 and H4 headers
- Blockqoutes
- Horizontal lines
- Bullet list
- Ordered list
- [Links](/guide/system/tipsandtricks "Links")
- Aligning text left, center, justify, right

Clear formatting by using the `Clear formatting` button on the rich text editor. The rich text editor also allows you to undo or redo your edits. Undo an edit by clicking on the `left arrow button`, redo an edit by clicking on the `right arrow button`.

Hovering over a button shows a tooltip explaining the buttons functionality.
