# Reservations

The reservations page is part of the bookings addon. Use the reservations page to create, view, update and delete reservations. Use the reservations and the rooms pages together to keep rooms up to date and create reservations for those rooms.

## 1. Reservations overview

Navigate to the **reservations** page to view all reservations on a per-room basis. The reservation pages uses a calandar system similar to what you are used to on the **calendar overview** page. Navigating through dates works in exactly the same way as on `Calendar` overview page. Please reference section 2 **Navigating the calendar overview** on the [Calendar page](/guide/scheduling/calendar/index.md "Calender page") for a tutorial on how to navigate through dates on the reservations page.
