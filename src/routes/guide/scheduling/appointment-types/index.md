# Appointment types

Appointment types are part of the `Scheduling` module. Appointment types are an easy way to quickly categorize all types of appointments you might need. This functionality saves you a lot of time as you do not have to enter all details of a (recurring) appointment from scratch.

## 1. Appointment types definition

Appointment types are presets created via the appointment types page. Appointment types allow you to set a defined time, length, color and description for a (recurring) meeting.

## 2. Appointment types overview

The appointment types overview can be accessed by clicking on the `Appointment types` button under the `General` section. Upon visiting this page, a list of all appointment types will be generated, allowing you to view, create, edit and delete appointment types.

## 3. Creating Appointment types

To start creating an appointment type, click on the `+ New` button. This will open a new page where you can fill in the details of the appointment type. Entering a name and a color is required for the appointment type to be created. The length as well as the description of an appointment type are optional and therefore do not need to be filled in.

### 3.1. Choosing a color

Clicking on the color field will open a small color selector like those seen in many image editing programs. Click anywhere on the hue bar to select a starting color. Use the brightness / saturation field to customize your color and finalize your selection.

### 3.2. Length of an appointment

The length of an appointment can be predefined via the `Hours` and `Minutes` fields. If you want your appointment to last for one hour and thirty minutes, enter one in the `hours` field and thrity in the `minutes` field. Don't worry, you can always change the length of your appointment after selecting the appointment type. The appointment type only fills in that length when initially adding it to an appointment.

### 3.3. Entering a description

An appointment type's description is automatically added to an appointment when selecting that appointment type. The description editor uses the rich text editor feature. The rich text editor feature allows you to edit text like you would in programs like Word or Pages.

### 3.4. Saving your appointment type

When editing your appointment type will automatically save as soon as you stop making changes, which is why there is no save button available. You can see the status of your appointment type via the save-status icon next to the delete button.

When creating an appointment type you have to finalize the creation process by clicking on the `+ Create` button.
