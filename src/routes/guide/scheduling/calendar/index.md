# Calendar

The calendar function is part of the essentials module in Hexa Center. Use the calendar function to create appointments, view your colleagues appointments and create video calls.

## 1. Navigating the calendar overview

The calendar overview can be found by navigating to the Calendar tab, found under the section `General`. The layout of the calendar overview is very similar to what most users are used to, bearing resemblance to the likes of Google and MacOS calendar apps.

## 1.1 Collapsing the navigation menu

To collapse, or hide, the navigation menu, click on the small arrow icon located at the very top of the calendar overview page. This action will entirely conceal the menu, providing a more spacious view of the calendar content.

## 1.2 Navigating through dates

By clicking on available time scope options, such as, `month,`, `week`, `workweek`, or `day`, you can switch between a more focused and a broader overview of your current schedule.

When you select `month`, the calendar will display all the days in a month, allowing you to have a comprehensive view of the entire month's events and appointments. Similarly, choosing 'week' will narrow down the display to show a week's worth of activities, while 'workweek' will focus on weekdays excluding weekends. If you opt for `day`, the calendar will concentrate solely on the events and tasks of the selected day.

Additionally, altering the scope of dates also affects the functionality of the navigation buttons. On the calendar interface, you will find two navigation buttons: a left button and a right button. When the scope is set to 'month', clicking the right button will advance the calendar by one month. Similarly, clicking the left button will take you back one month. This navigation behavior applies to the other scope options as well, aligning with your current selection.

Clicking on `today` brings you back to today's date.

## 2. Creating appointments

Click on any square in the calendar overview screen to open the appointment creation screen, next, input event details like the title, description, date, start time, and end time. The date / time you clicked on is used as the initial start and end date / time for the appointment, depending on the current scope.

You will need to enter the appointment name, calendar, start and end time to create an appointment. Adding a description, appointment type, inviting guests and the video-call invite checkbox are all optional.

Save your appointment by clicking on the `+ create` button.

## 2.1 Creating appointments in other calendars

To create an appointment for someone else by selecting that person via the Calendar dropdown option. You can only create appointments in someone else's calendar if you have the required permissions to do so. This option is dependent on the `General > appointments > Manage all appointments`.

## 4. Deleting appointments
