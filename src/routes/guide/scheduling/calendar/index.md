# Calendar

The calendar module is part of the essentials module in Hexa Center. Use the calendar function to create appointments, view your colleagues appointments and create video calls.

## 1. Navigating the calendar overview

The calendar overview can be found by navigating to the Calendar tab, found under the section `General`. The layout of the calendar overview is very similar to what most users are used to, bearing resemblance to the likes of Google and MacOS calendar apps.

### 1.1 Collapsing the navigation menu

To collapse, or hide, the navigation menu, click on the small arrow icon located at the very top of the calendar overview page. This action will entirely conceal the menu, providing a more spacious view of the calendar content.

### 1.2 Navigating through dates

By clicking on one the available time scope options: `month`, `week`, `workweek`, or `day`, you can switch between focused and broader overviews.

When selecting `month`, the calendar will display all the days in a month, allowing you to have a comprehensive view of the entire month's events and appointments. Similarly, choosing 'week' will narrow down the display to show a week's worth of activities, while 'workweek' will focus on weekdays excluding weekends. If you opt for `day`, the calendar will concentrate solely on the events and tasks of the selected day.

Additionally, altering the scope of dates also affects the functionality of the navigation buttons. On the calendar interface, you will find two navigation buttons: a left button and a right button. When the scope is set to 'month', clicking the right button will advance the calendar by one month. Similarly, clicking the left button will take you back one month. This navigation behavior applies to the other scope options as well, aligning with your current selection.

Clicking on `today` brings you back to today's date.

## 2. Creating appointments

Click on any square in the calendar overview screen to open the appointment creation screen, next, fill in event details like the title, description, date, start time, and end time. The date / time you clicked on is used as the initial start and end date / time for the appointment, depending on the current scope.

Add guests via the `Guests` field. Click on the `Guests` field to see all available guests. To search for users, simply enter their name or a part of it in the search field. As you begin typing, the available options will be automatically updated in real-time.

You will need to enter the appointment name, calendar, start and end time to create an appointment.
Adding a description, appointment type, inviting guests and the video-call invite checkbox are all optional.

Save your appointment by clicking on the `+ create` button.

## 2.1 Sending emails

Upon creating, editing, or deleting an appointment which contains guests, you will be greeted by a window asking if you would like to send emails out to the appointments participants.

Click on `Don't send` to not send out any emails and save your changes.

Click on `Send` to send out emails to all participants, informing them of the update/cancellation.

Click on `Back to editing` to make further changes.

### 2.2 Creating appointments in other calendars

To create appointments on behalf of someone else, begin by selecting that person through the Calendar dropdown option. You can only create appointments in another person's calendar if you have the necessary permissions to do so. This capability is determined by the `General > Appointments > Manage all appointments` permission.

## 3. Editing appointments

To edit an existing appointment, select it from the calendar overview screen, a new window will now open allowing you to make changes. Click on the `+ Save` button to save your changes.

## 4. Deleting appointments

To delete an existing appointment, select it from the calendar overview screen. In the window click on the `delete` button to permanently delete the appointment.
